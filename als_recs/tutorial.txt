///ALS_RECS TUTORIAL MODE///
////////////////////////////

The folowing example will demonstrate how to use the als_recs Python
library. The dataset used here is a modified version from the Online 
Retail one present in UCI's repositories. You can find it in the following
link:

The data passed to the tool must be in LONG format, where each row is an
implicit interaction the Client had with a given Product. The data must
contain three columns: one with the ClientID, another with the ProductID
of the Product the Client interacted with and a last column containing the
Implicit Score calculated from this interaction.

This way, the data should look something like this:

+-----------+------------+----------------+
| client_id | product_id | implicit_score |
+-----------+------------+----------------+
|  85123A   |   17856    |   15.304688    |
|  71053    |   12537    |   20.343750    |
|  84406B   |   17559    |   22.000000    |
+-----------+------------+----------------+           

The columns don't need to be in the same order, but it is important to 
pass the right names for the ClientID (cli_col) and ProductID (prd_col)
columns when calling the tool. It is not necessary to pass the name of the
column containing the Implicit Score, but you must guarantee the dataset 
has only 3 columns.

As of the columns data types, the only requirement is that the Implicit
Score column be numeric.
